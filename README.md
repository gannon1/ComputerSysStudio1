# ComputerSysStudio1
The purpose of this site is to promote a media company that is offering it's services. There are six main pages of the site, they are: the home page, about page, production page, services page, projects page and the contact page. This site has two features, an image gallery and a form. I chose to go with a darker design choice because it was similar to other media sites that I had seen before. I ran into issues with the responsive design and also working with flexboxes. I learned many things from this project with one of those things being that css is a large aspect of web design.
